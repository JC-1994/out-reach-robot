The are  several constraints imposed on this project, such as the limitation of cost, schedule, or resources.  

Constraints are imposed upon us by our client, organization, government regulations, availability of resources, etc. Occasionally, identified constraints turn out to be false. This is often beneficial to the development team, since it removes items that could potentially affect progress.

The following list contains key constraints related to the implementation and testing of the project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Final prototype demonstration must be completed by May 1st, 2020
  \item Total development costs must not exceed \$1000
  \item The robotic arm should not have any sharp edges.
  \item The arm should accept G-code created by inputting the SVG file.
  \item The drawing app will not run on IOS devices. 
\end{itemize}
