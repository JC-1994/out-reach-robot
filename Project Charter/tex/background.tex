%An in-depth explanation of the problem, including the "business case". What is wrong with the status-quo or what opportunity exists that justifies undertaking this project (expanding upon the vision statement)? If you have a clear customer or sponsor, why do they want you to work on this? What is the existing relationship, if any, between the development team and the customer? This section should occupy 1/2 - 1 full page.
The purpose of this project is to wow potential students of computer science/engineering with a project that will be able to be completed in the span of two semesters. Most people are interested in things of the future. While we may use robots today in certain applications, robots are not yet common place. A robotic arm drawing what you draw on a tablet will be used to provide that wow factor. It will make the student think if a robotic arm can copy what I draw on this tablet what else can it do? This system will let the potential student know if they choose to pursue engineering they too can work of technologies of the future if they decide to do so.
