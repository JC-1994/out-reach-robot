There are some risks associated with this project. As it is a robotic project there are also some external risks associated with it along with internal risks. The probability of occurrence, size of loss, and risk exposure will also be listed below.


The following high level risk census contains identified project risks with the highest exposure. Mitigation strategies will be discussed in our future planning sessions.
